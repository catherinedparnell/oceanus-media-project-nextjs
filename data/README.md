## Data Methodology
All data was gotten from [Our World in Data: Plastic Pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution). We saved and pulled in csv data from their visualizations into three different Python scripts. The data from these Python scripts were then cleaned, manipulated and written into a JavaScript-readable JSON format with correct attributes to match the visualizations we wanted to portray. To put the visualizations into JavaScript we used [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), specifically the pre-made library for [React Chart.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2), which we loaded the JSON data into and tweaked for styling purposes.
