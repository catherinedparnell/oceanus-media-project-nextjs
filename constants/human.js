  graphTitle: 'Estimated count (n^10) of microplastic particles in surface oceans',
  graphCaption: 'There are almost 5 TRILLION PARTICLES of microplastics in the world\'s surface oceans.',
  ingest: 'Many marine animals ingest particles of microplastic pollution.',
  dinner: 'Microplastics ingested by sea creatures can eventually end up on our own dinner plates.',
  eat: 'As the last stop in the ocean food chain, humans are susceptible to the consequences of plastic pollution, just like the fish we eat.',
  extent: 'We still do not know the true extent of microplastics\' impacts on human health. However, researchers estimate that human microplastics consumption ranges from 39,000 to 52,000 particles, and traces of microplastics have been found in human organs.',
  harm: 'One potentially serious harm posed to humans is due to plastic’s ability to accumulate contaminants like PCBs and pesticides, which then might leach into our bodies once the particles are ingested.',
  final: 'We still have a lot to learn, but when it comes to our own health and our family’s health, it\'s best to steer towards the side of caution.',
