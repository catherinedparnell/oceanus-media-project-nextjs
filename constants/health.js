  microplastic: 'Microplastics are small particles of plastic that are less than 5 mm in diameter.',
  harmful: 'Microplastics, because of their tiny size, have the potential to be very harmful to marine organisms and humans.',
  ingestion: 'Because the small particles are easily mistaken for food, the main concern with microplastics is ingestion by wildlife. Organisms can ingest microplastics through three main mechanisms: uptake by filter feeders, swallowing from surrounding water, or consuming other organisms that have already ingested microplastics.',
  negative: 'Microplastics have a variety of negative impacts on sea creatures. It has been shown that microplastic ingestion impacts prey consumption, which leads to energy depletion and inhibited growth and fertility.',
  examples: 'Plastic has caused slower metabolic rate and survival in mussels, reduced energy stores in crabs, and reduced growth and development in plankton.',
  poisonous: 'Plastic particles not only disrupt the digestive and metabolic systems of marine animals, but they also can also expose animals to poisonous substances once consumed.',
  toxins: 'Plastics attract toxins like a magnet, absorbing toxins like PCBs and pesticides that prefer to stick to plastic rather than other substances in the ocean; this allows for the concentration and accumulation of pollutants on microplastics.',
  leach: 'When animals accidentally consume plastic particles in the ocean, these chemical pollutants leach into their stomachs and harm their health.',
  question: 'If microplastics are harming animals in these ways, what are they doing to us?',
  sectionHeader: 'Microplastics impact human health.',
  biomagnification: 'Microplastics––and the toxic chemicals attached to them––concentrate as they make there way up the food chain in a process called biomagnification.',
  plate: 'This means that the plastic ingested by sea creatures can eventually end up on our own dinner plates, whether it’s a platter of tuna sushi, a plate of mussels, or a tilapia filet.',
  understand: 'We are still trying to understand the extent of plastic’s impact on human health.',
  linked: 'What we do know is that toxins in plastics have been linked to cancers, birth defects, immune system problems, and childhood developmental issues in humans.',
  you: 'As ocean plastics continue to break down into microplastics in the coming decades, their impact on the health of you and your loved ones will become more and more important and potentially hazardous.',
