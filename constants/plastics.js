  lifecycle: ['The Lifecycle of Plastic',
    'About 6% of global oil consumption goes toward plastic production.',
    'The first phase of the plastic lifecycle is production. From 1950 to 2015, the world produced a total of 7.8 billion tons of plastic.',
    'In the next phase of the plastic lifecycle, plastic products are used by consumers, companies, and industries.',
    'The 55% of plastic that is not recycled or incinerated heads for disposal as waste. This is the stage where plastic that is not properly disposed of can make its way into our waterways and oceans.',
    'After use, about 20% of global plastic waste is recycled and made into new plastic products.',
  ],
  long: 'Plastics that make their way into the ocean have a tendency to stay there for a long, long time. Their buoyancy allows them to float along the ocean\'s surface, transported by winds and surface currents.',
  macroplastic: 'There are currently an estimated 233,400 tons of macroplastics just in the world\'s surface oceans. Macroplastics are pieces of plastic that are larger than 5 mm in diameter.',
  graphmacroTitle: 'Estimated weight of macroplastics in tons',
  patch: 'Plastics tend to gather toward the center of ocean basins rather than coastal regions. The most famous large accumulation of plastic in our oceans\' surface waters is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). This enormous patch of garbage spans almost 700 million square miles, an area slightly larger than Alaska, the United Statesâ€™ largest state. The patch lies in the area between Hawaii and California and contains 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic that weigh a total of 79,000 tons.',
  decades: 'Plastics in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and all throughout the ocean persist for decades. There are plastic objects in the ocean that date as far back as the 1950s. The longer the plastics exist in the ocean, the more and more they break down into smaller and smaller pieces, via ultraviolet light and mechanical wave forces, eventually becoming microplastics. In fact, an estimated 94% of the 1.8 trillion plastic pieces of the GPGP are actually microplastics, indicating that they are a growing problem and the eventual fate of large macroplastics that originally enter the ocean.',
  microplastic: 'Microplastics are plastic particles that are smaller than 5 mm in diameter. Once plastic is broken into these tiny pieces, it is more easily ingested by marine organisms and mixed into ocean sediments. Microplastics also often end up washed up, buried, or resurfaced along our coastlines and beaches.',
  particles: 'There are an estimated 5 trillion particles of microplastics just in the surface waters of our global oceans.',
